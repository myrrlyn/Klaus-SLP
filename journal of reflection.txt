JOURNAL OF REFLECTION
Insert your journal of reflections here.
The reflections will include not only what went right or wrong with the project but also personal reflection of how you felt throughout the process and certainly once done. How were the stakeholders affected by the  project? How was the original goal identified by the group completed? Were goals modified as time went on? How and why? How did the course work at Culver help in the project?
Reflections should be done at each step of the project. The dates of your journal should mirror the dates of significant changes, steps and/or activities completed or notable interactions with group members or stakeholders. For example, after visiting the homeless shelter for the first time, you would want to take time to reflect on this experience and describe your observations and feelings. The idea is to heighten your awareness, think about what you have learned and how it connects with other aspects of your life. The questions below will help you through the reflection process.
Description  of what you observed: who, when, where and what (the interaction, conflict, challenge, feeling of accomplishment and resulting actions and problem solving that took place).
How you felt about it.
