					This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2018.

							A contingent of fifty-seven scouts, under the supervision of eight adults, journeys to Mackinac Island to work for a week. A central part of the performance on the island is the marching and raising and lowering of flags across state property on the island. To ensure uniform action and performance, these drill actions are practiced prior to departure from the mainland. The contingent meets in the parking lot of Whirlpool international headquarters for its copious flagpoles. The troop is divided into three patrols, one of which works the flagpoles while the other two practice dismounted drill in the parking lot. Serving as senior patrol leader, it was my responsibility to assemble the troop and instruct the troop on expectations for Mackinac, as well as brief the leaders on the duties and instructions for them to carry out. The two hour practice with fifty eight boys meant one hundred and sixteen man hours towards the goal of creating a functioning, performing troop for the duties of Mackinac.

							This was the second day of practice for the contingent and the last two hours to drill before departing to the island. As some members cannot attend both practices, all information must be repeated. Marching and flags are rehearsed again, and the remaining movements learned. This practice was made more complicated by my absence-I was busy the weekend of the second practice at school and could not attend. The assistant senior patrol leader, Noah Kalthoff, covered for me and ran the practice The patrols decided on their official names and were given the final remarks before the departure to Mackinac. At seven the troop wrapped up the practice and dispersed for the last time before assembling on the docks to Mackinac.

							On Saturday, July 6th, fifty-seven scouts and eight adults gathered to travel to Mackinac Island.  As Senior Patrol Leader, (SPL), I was responsible for the formation, instruction, and embarkation of my scouts onboard the ferry to Mackinac Island.  
Once on Mackinac Island, I was responsible to ensure that the scouts traveled to the Scout Barracks and made it their home for the next 8 days.
Education began at once, and I ensured the scouts began training on the history of the island, and its historical parks and battlefields.  Each scout was encouraged to earn a meritorious award for learning additional history and legends of the island.
						</p>
						<p>
							The first flag ceremony was conducted, requiring 48 scouts to simultaneously lower the island flags upon command. After the flag ceremony, dinner was run, the scouts turned loose for recreation. At ten o clock the junior leadership and I put the scouts to bed and headed to the leadership debrief/brief with the adults. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I ran the first meeting, briefing the junior and adult leaders on the past day and the challenges of the next day. After the meeting closed, we all went to bed.

							I woke up just before six to take care of my toilet before waking the junior leaders. Junior leaders day begins at 0630, to be in place and prepped before the Scouts are woken. General reveille sounds at 0645, consisting of me standing on the laundry table in the middle of the bunk area shouting “Good morning Mackinac!” with gusto and enthusiasm. 
						</p>
						<p>
							After the scouts are roused from their slumber, cleaning begins at 0700. The patrols clean the barracks in three general areas, one patrol per area in a rotating schedule throughout the week. After inspection, breakfast is served and then the Scouts change for flags. The barracks colors are raised first at 0900, and then the forty eight flag locations across the state park are raised at 0930. 
						</p>
						<p>
							After flags, the duty shifts began. Each patrol works three hours at a time in a rotating succession at state park historical sites both in the fort and downtown. They serve as tourist guides and representatives of the state parks. Prior to the downtown buildings opening at 1100, the downtown guides clean Marquette Park-the downtown park-of trash. 
						</p>
						<p>
							After the three shifts conclude at 1800, the troop forms up at the barracks and runs flags. After the flags, the troop runs barracks colors and changes for dinner.

							The routine established the first day does not change. I roused the troop at 0630, followed by cleaning and flags, guide duty, and closing with flags. With the routine established, the days began to be dedicated to special projects. I established these tasks during this day, laying ground work for the rest of the week. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Each patrol is expected to complete a service project while on the island. I requested these service projects starting today, but they were planned across Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Typical projects include repainting park facilities or taking down the bunting from the Fourth of July. We were not given any details as to the exact nature of our projects at this time. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Extra duty, the punishment for a failure to meet the standards of behavior, began today. The extra duty consists of preparing flags for the retirement ceremony later in the week by cutting the stripes and blue field apart from one another. The remainder of the ED is assigned as cleaning tasks to prepare the barracks for the final inspection on Saturday.

						Tuesday is the day of midweek inspection, as our week runs from Saturday to Saturday. This inspection evaluates our visible performance of course, but also our behavior in and maintenance of our living space-the Scout Barracks.
						</p>
						<p>
						The evaluative nature of the day meant that the leadership was on edge and intensely focused, especially in the tourist guide portion of the day. The three shifts passed by slowly, with Noah my ASPL and myself patrolling all day to observe our Scouts on duty. The day started out on a bad foot with a late departure to flags due to a little miscommunication, making the leadership nervous. However, the day proceeded forward without any other issues.
						</p>
						<p>
							The results of the day were highly satisfactory. The midweek inspection sheet is a grade sheet on a value of one to four, indicating our performance. We received between three and four across the board, except for one two. This two was in timeliness and an understandable correction.
						</p>
						<p>
							The junior leadership meeting that night reviewed the day, and carried a congratulatory tone. The troop is coming together well and performing at an acceptable rate.

							Accomplishments:

							Wednesday is the last routine day. As such, it is particularly important to have the troop running smoothly by the end of the day. This is the last chance for me and my Patrol Leaders to iron out any wrinkles. Beginning tomorrow, special schedules will make life very interesting. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Flags and duties ran without a hitch. Noah and I completed the mail run, checking on the Scouts on both first and second shift. Afterwards, we managed to squeeze in our first nap of the week. This relaxation at the top of the leadership chain was made possible by the efforts of those below us. The troop is functioning very well. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Team formation usually follows four phases-described as forming, storming, norming, and performing. Forming is the introductory phase-high enthusiasm and low skills. This is the first couple days on the island. Storming follows, marked by pushback against Troop leadership and cranky attitudes-low enthusiasm and low skills. Norming is the rise of skill and its matched rise in enthusiasm. Performing is the final phase of team development-high skill and high enthusiasm. The troop is balanced on the edge of performing, safely through the storming phase. The adults and I are pleased with the performance, and Maggie agrees.

							Accomplishments:
							<li>
								Prepared for the unique schedule of the next two days.

							Thursday is a busy day for community involvement.  Eight scouts patrolled and cleaned Marquette Park for two hours.  The scouts accumulated fourteen pounds of trash and waste.  The waste was sorted and delivered to the landfill and the Mackinac Island compost facility.
						</p>
						<p>
							After lunch sixteen Scouts were directed to assist the Mackinac Island maintenance personnel with the unloading of cement bags for the construction of stairs at Arch Rock-a local natural monument. The previous steps, a wooden construction, had washed out in the rains and snow the previous winter. The new steps were being installed that weekend, and we unloaded over twenty thousand pounds of concrete for this use. This served as one of the three service projects my troop would complete. 
						</p>
						<p>
							At dinner, the announcements are made. The senior patrol leaders will be gone tonight, and the six honor guard members will be in charge. The final review is tomorrow, the grades that determine whether the troop will be invited to return next year. In this vein, we need to be on our best behavior tonight and begin preparing for the final inspection on Friday. The leaders and cooks and anyone on their last year departed for the town, to celebrate our last night on the island.

							Friday is the last day of our service on the island. It begins with the leaders groggily rolling out of bed and a series of announcements up and down the bunks. Friday is the day of the final inspection, the grading that will be responsible for determining whether or not the troop will be able to return next year. This is a very important day-for flags, duties, and barrack cleanliness. We will see these grades Saturday morning-we will be graded all day. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This is also an important day for the troop in a ceremonial fashion. There are certain rituals the troop takes part in every year, saying goodbye to the island and the boys who will not be returning. These went well-as will be discussed in proper order during the day’s summary. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Starting with cleaning in the morning and flag duties, the troop was on it’s A game. We looked very good to the junior and adult leadership who observed. Duties ran smoothly, the day quickly going underway. Laundry closed at noon to allow everyone to begin packing up their clothes. I want everyone to be packed, we leave the barracks at 5:30 tomorrow. The day ran very well, and the special schedules began at dinner. 
						</p>
						<p>
								After dinner, the troop lines up and marches to Marquette Park. I put my mature junior leaders in charge of this. The fifty boys will police Marquette Park to look for any trash and litter in the park. Meanwhile, a team of six selected scouts led by myself will clean the dining room and half of the bathroom of the barracks. These will be totally cleaned and prepared for inspection, and then not used again. They are taped off to make this point clear. After cleaning is completed-sweeping, mopping, dusting, etc-the troop forms up outside the barracks. We process single file to Greeney Grove, a firebowl named after a previous scoutmaster. Here, I lead a flag retirement ceremony for the scouts. In silence, the flags are burnt and taps played in the stillness of night. We move to the Upper Gun Deck of the fort, where Inspiration Point is held. This is our goodbye to all the boys who are too old to return next year, and their goodbye to the island. The graduating scouts have the opportunity to share their thoughts and memories with the returning scouts-what it means to them and the friends they have had. It reduces about two thirds of the troop to tears each year, seeing your best friends leave and closing the door forever on such a wonderful experience. 
						</p>
						<p>
								After inspiration point, we head back, and we go to bed. Laundry is sorted, and some packing, but I put the troop to bed quickly, anticipating the early morning of tomorrow.

							Saturday began early, as the troop would be moving out of the barracks. At 0530, the Junior Leadership were awake. The final toiletries taken care of and packed before the Junior Leadership Cadre wakes the troop. The troop wakes, we brush our teeth, and we leave the barracks. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A group of Scouts, including Noah and myself, stay behind to clean the barracks. The adults help, and we deep clean the remaining bathroom showers, stalls, sinks, and mirrors. Upstairs is swept and mopped from end to end, all eighteen windows cleaned, and every shelf dusted. The dining room is closed and cleaned from the previous night, the same for the kitchen. After donuts on the porch for the troop, both porches are swept and mopped as well. After this final cleaning, from 0600 to 0800 approximately, the troop forms up and sweeps the front lawn. The police line picks up any trash left in the grass, the final piece of the cleaning experience. With the barracks area clear, the baggage packed on drays to go to the dock, the troop has officially moved out of the barracks. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The troop formed up and marched to Post Cemetery, as a troop. There, the ASPL and I raised the flag to half mast one last time, and we marched back to the barracks. We formed up, raised the barracks flags, and marched to our flag posts. As each post was complete, the Scouts there fell in to the Troop formation, marched through the fort to town, and arrived on the ferry dock. The week on Mackinac was complete.
