								It&rsquo;s all over! It&rsquo;s hard to believe I&rsquo;ve been working on this project  for about a year now. I&rsquo;m so glad I chose to run the blood drive as my  senior service project. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, come a long way, and have a  new appreciation for those Red Cross volunteers! I only had to give up  two days to run bloodmobiles, but they do it all the time&hellip;quite the  task, I&rsquo;d say. Over these past several months, I&rsquo;ve spent my service  time organizing materials for the drives, advertising for the  bloodmobiles, signing people up, donating my own blood, and  facilitating all the details of the drives on both December 7th and  March 11th.
							</p>
							<p>
								It went really well over all. Granted, since this is  about the twentieth time the Red Cross has come to Culver it&rsquo;s pretty  hard to screw up, but someone still has to do it. There were eight  seniors who chose to do this as their senior service project this year,  which I think is so exciting because it means a lot of people were  interested! If that hadn&rsquo;t been the case, those students who perhaps  would reluctantly volunteer for lack of a better idea may not have put  forth so much effort. With so many people it would be easy to  slack-off, but we had nearly 100% attendance at every meeting and  bloodmobile, and everyone was equally eager to give up their extra time  to help set up and clean up for both events.
							</p>
							<p>
								That being said, I think the most important strengths people brought to  the project were vitality/zest and kindness. Along the way, yet other  characteristics manifested themselves, such as teamwork, when we  coordinated all our ideas to get everything accomplished;  industry/persistence, as we all went the extra mile to make certain all  our plans when off without a hitch; and creativity, such as the times  we decided to play music to soothe peoples&rsquo; nerves, or wear the blood  drop costume during lunch to attract potential donors. Surely our  project ended up even more successful because of these traits, but none  of our goals would have come to fruition without the innate enthusiasm  we all had for the project on account of our generosity, compassion,  and willingness to give back to the community. I suppose I can&rsquo;t speak  for everyone, but as far as I know, we all had a great time helping out  and even made some new friends in the form of Red Cross nurses!
							</p>
							<p>
								Though it&rsquo;s a long process with a lot of &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; work  comprised of organization, preparation, and meeting, the really  treasured parts are the blood drives themselves. And I promise, it has  nothing to do with getting out of classes! From lugging heavy boxes and  carts full of equipment off the trucks and into the gym, despite of  cold weather, to being ready with an orange juice or chocolate chip  cookie at a moment&rsquo;s notice, to letting strangers stick needles into me  and pump out my blood, <em>those </em>days  are the best ones! It&rsquo;s always a warm feeling when you see your  friends, teachers, and coaches walk into the gym, maybe despite their  fears or busy schedules, to give blood and help out others. Of course,  there&rsquo;s a social element to it all as well, and I particularly enjoyed  &ldquo;comforting&rdquo; my friends after their donation experience during the 10  minute waiting period. Admittedly, there were times Mr. Chastain  suggested I be a little less interested in the conversations that  occurred among the &ldquo;well&rdquo; donors, and focused a tad more on those who  actually needed my assistance! It was never for lack of trying that I  neglected a duty, but only because I became so excited about something  else going on that I simply got distracted. Talk about zest!
							</p>
							<p>
								If I  had been a junior this year and so had the opportunity to work on the  blood drive again next year, I think I would still push to get them to  come maybe one more time. It just seems logical that they come more  often when someone could theoretically give blood six times a year. I  would also try to plan for the blood drives we definitely do have a bit  earlier also &ndash; it takes more time to coordinate meeting times,  advertise and post flyers, get announcements in the DB and at the  all-school than one might think! Next time, too, I may finally muster  the courage to don the blood drop suit during my lunch hour&hellip;just maybe!  With enough time and preparation, those who take on the task next year  might consider yet more options for advertising also. Or encouraging,  anyway. It seems a lot of people <em>know </em>about  the blood drive, but aren&rsquo;t necessarily convinced of its importance,  and so let little scheduling conflicts or a minor fear of needles get  in the way. Possibly if we put together a power point presentation to  show during an assembly that really demonstrates how much your donation  can do and how many lives it can save, it may pull at enough heart  strings to bump the number of units up so we can reach our goals.
							</p>
							<p>
								I  remember in my initial course reflections I wrote about how I used to  donate my allowance money to animal shelters. Even though this  experience with service seems quite different, it all evokes the same  emotions. After stuffing my crumpled one and five dollar bills into an  envelope after reading a particularly moving letter from the ASPCA or  other rescue agency, I would spend the rest of the day wondering what  little kitten my contribution would save, or what puppy would find a  new home. Now, after I come to after passing out from donating blood,  regardless of shaky limbs or bruised veins, I have the privilege of day  dreaming for hours afterwards, thinking about the tiny baby who can now  grow up strong, or the victim in a car crash whose life will be saved  because of a blood transfusion. Particularly because, as an O+ blood  type, I am a universal donor, I feel my blood has particular value in  helping those around me. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I no longer receive an  allowance, that my bank account balance is $2.08 or that I can&rsquo;t write  a check to fund a gigantic public library. My contribution is valuable  no matter what, and so is everyone else&rsquo;s (as long as you don&rsquo;t have  AIDS, or with a few other exceptions&hellip;). Regardless of any temporary  setback, or maybe even more so because of that sacrifice, giving to  others in your community who are in need is <em>always</em> a great feeling!
