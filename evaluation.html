					This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2018.

					It&rsquo;s all over! It&rsquo;s hard to believe I&rsquo;ve been working on this project for about a year now. I&rsquo;m so glad I chose to run the blood drive as my senior service project. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, come a long way, and have a new appreciation for those Red Cross volunteers! I only had to give up two days to run bloodmobiles, but they do it all the time&hellip;quite the task, I&rsquo;d say. Over these past several months, I&rsquo;ve spent my service time organizing materials for the drives, advertising for the bloodmobiles, signing people up, donating my own blood, and facilitating all the details of the drives on both December 7th and March 11th.
				</p>
				<p>
					It went really well over all. Granted, since this is about the twentieth time the Red Cross has come to Culver it&rsquo;s pretty hard to screw up, but someone still has to do it. There were eight seniors who chose to do this as their senior service project this year, which I think is so exciting because it means a lot of people were interested! If that hadn&rsquo;t been the case, those students who perhaps would reluctantly volunteer for lack of a better idea may not have put forth so much effort. With so many people it would be easy to slack-off, but we had nearly 100% attendance at every meeting and bloodmobile, and everyone was equally eager to give up their extra time to help set up and clean up for both events.
				</p>
				<p>
					That being said, I think the most important strengths people brought to the project were vitality/zest and kindness. Along the way, yet other characteristics manifested themselves, such as teamwork, when we  coordinated all our ideas to get everything accomplished; industry/persistence, as we all went the extra mile to make certain all our plans when off without a hitch; and creativity, such as the times we decided to play music to soothe peoples&rsquo; nerves, or wear the blood drop costume during lunch to attract potential donors. Surely our project ended up even more successful because of these traits, but none of our goals would have come to fruition without the innate enthusiasm we all had for the project on account of our generosity, compassion,  and willingness to give back to the community. I suppose I can&rsquo;t speak for everyone, but as far as I know, we all had a great time helping out and even made some new friends in the form of Red Cross nurses!
				</p>
				<p>
					Though it&rsquo;s a long process with a lot of &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; work comprised of organization, preparation, and meeting, the really treasured parts are the blood drives themselves. And I promise, it has  nothing to do with getting out of classes! From lugging heavy boxes and  carts full of equipment off the trucks and into the gym, despite of cold weather, to being ready with an orange juice or chocolate chip  cookie at a moment&rsquo;s notice, to letting strangers stick needles into me and pump out my blood, <em>those</em> days are the best ones! It&rsquo;s always a warm feeling when you see your friends, teachers, and coaches walk into the gym, maybe despite their fears or busy schedules, to give blood and help out others. Of course,  there&rsquo;s a social element to it all as well, and I particularly enjoyed &ldquo;comforting&rdquo; my friends after their donation experience during the 10 minute waiting period. Admittedly, there were times Mr. Chastain suggested I be a little less interested in the conversations that  occurred among the &ldquo;well&rdquo; donors, and focused a tad more on those who actually needed my assistance! It was never for lack of trying that I neglected a duty, but only because I became so excited about something  else going on that I simply got distracted. Talk about zest!
				</p>
				<p>
					If I had been a junior this year and so had the opportunity to work on the  blood drive again next year, I think I would still push to get them to come maybe one more time. It just seems logical that they come more  often when someone could theoretically give blood six times a year. I would also try to plan for the blood drives we definitely do have a bit earlier also &ndash; it takes more time to coordinate meeting times, advertise and post flyers, get announcements in the DB and at the all-school than one might think! Next time, too, I may finally muster the courage to don the blood drop suit during my lunch hour&hellip;just maybe! With enough time and preparation, those who take on the task next year might consider yet more options for advertising also. Or encouraging, anyway. It seems a lot of people <em>know</em> about the blood drive, but aren&rsquo;t necessarily convinced of its importance, and so let little scheduling conflicts or a minor fear of needles get in the way. Possibly if we put together a power point presentation to show during an assembly that really demonstrates how much your donation can do and how many lives it can save, it may pull at enough heart strings to bump the number of units up so we can reach our goals.
				</p>

					I remember in my initial course reflections I wrote about how I used to  donate my allowance money to animal shelters. Even though this experience with service seems quite different, it all evokes the same  emotions. After stuffing my crumpled one and five dollar bills into an  envelope after reading a particularly moving letter from the ASPCA or other rescue agency, I would spend the rest of the day wondering what  little kitten my contribution would save, or what puppy would find a new home. Now, after I come to after passing out from donating blood,  regardless of shaky limbs or bruised veins, I have the privilege of day dreaming for hours afterwards, thinking about the tiny baby who can now  grow up strong, or the victim in a car crash whose life will be saved  because of a blood transfusion. Particularly because, as an O+ blood  type, I am a universal donor, I feel my blood has particular value in  helping those around me. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that I no longer receive an allowance, that my bank account balance is $2.08 or that I can&rsquo;t write a check to fund a gigantic public library. My contribution is valuable  no matter what, and so is everyone else&rsquo;s (as long as you don&rsquo;t have AIDS, or with a few other exceptions&hellip;). Regardless of any temporary setback, or maybe even more so because of that sacrifice, giving to  others in your community who are in need is <em>always</em> a great feeling!
