					This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2014. For more information, follow the links provided on the left hand side of the page.

				Project Evaluation
			</h1>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
					The project was completed on 07/13/2013, and the write up completed on 12/22/2013. This has been a learning experience for me, as was intended. There are many factors that have impacted the way I have experienced this project and how it has impacted me. Like my time on Mackinac, my journey towards this project began at the age of eleven and ran for seven years. I am glad to see my project complete and I believe that I was successful in achieving my goals. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I set out to uphold three tenants in my project - service to the park, training of younger Scouts, and the continuation of Troop 623's Mackinac tenure. These goals were each upheld to the standard required and beyond. in terms of these three goals, the project was a rousing success. Evidence of each of these successes is found in the documents section, in the Final Inspection results. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The service to the park is the primary purpose of the project, and it was fully and satisfactorily completed. The patrols undertook four service projects in total, moving over ten thousand pounds of concrete for new stairs in one of them. In addition, the troop received exemplary grades in the inspections of both daily flag duties and guide posts. The Troop serves the park for one week, but we leave our mark in the GSI (guest service interpreters) with whom we interact and the condition in which we leave the barracks. This impact is one that can last much longer than a week. Upon arriving at the barracks, it is apparent to me how the last troop left the barracks. I made sure that the barracks and the impression my Troop left behind were the best possible. Under my leadership, the Troop provided consistent and capable service to the park and exceeded the standards we had set for the week. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The training of the Scouts was very successful. Every trip to the Island is an opportunity to practice, perfect, and peer review leadership traits. This lets Scouts see and experience different leadership styles and try them out ourselves. Also, with 58 boys, only a handful are Eagle Scouts. This means that the vast majority of the Scouts are able to use their time in such a Scout-heavy environment to advance along the Trail to Eagle. The week provides bountiful opportunities for training, learning, and mentoring of novice scouts and junior leaders. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The third tenant, maintain the traditions and quality of Troop 623, was satisfactorily completed. The Troop has fifty two years of tradition on the Island, and aims to continue to serve on the Island as long as the boys are capable. The quantifiable evidence of the Troop's continued excellence under my guidance is in the inspection results. However, the troop also upheld its traditions by seeing innovative leadership, dedication, and Scout initiative take a major role. The adult leaders found themselves in a periphery role this year. The Scoutmaster, Mr. Pschigoda, remarked that it was a new experience and there were clear changes in the leadership dynamic this year. This is exactly what I was looking for. I was elated to have such complete response, especially early in the week. The Scouting movement, akin to Culver, seeks to create an environment where the young men lead and the adults are merely a safety net. I implemented this system in the Mackinac Troop and in my Junior Leadership, allowing great strides in placing responsibility in the hands of the Junior Leadership. This is the aspect of my project of which I am most proud.
