					This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2018. For more information, follow the links provided on the left hand side of the page.

				<h3>
					Stakeholder Reflection
				</h3>
				<p>
					My project will have impacted many people. Although I will only be taking a week out of my summer, I will be improving the summers of thousands of other people. The state park on Mackinac Island gets between eight hundred and a thousand tourists coming through it per day, which is only a small fraction of tourists on the whole island. These are all people that will be impacted by my project. Furthermore, the statepark on Mackinac, the businesses from which we buy, and every picture we take of a tourist smiling on Upper Gun Deck over the Mackinac Straits will have impact on people. The meaning of my project far transcends merely aiding the state park; it affects thousands of men, women, and children in a very direct and meaningful way.
				</p>
				<h3>
					Primary Stakeholder Reflection
				</h3>
				<p>
					The primary stakeholder of my project is the Michigan State Park of Mackinac Island. The Park Service is the organization for whom we volunteer, and we help them by serving the tourists. Though the tourists are very important stakeholders, I believe the Park Service is the primary because helping the tourists helps the Service in turn.
				</p>
				<p>
					Running the state park, especially in recent years, has been difficult, as the budget to clean and maintain the island is shrinking. My project helps maintain the island for no labor costs; an example of this is my troop moving over ten tons of cement by hand to build a new staircase for Arch Rock. Another is our provision of tour guides both experienced and new for no cost, and sometimes we even bring new employees to the island &ndash; two of our buglers were offered jobs for their fantastic performances. Every day, I did the &quot;mail run&quot; and retrieved and delivered mail for the park services. My project helped maintain and improve the parks, without draining any of their resources, and through this we improved the vacation of thousands of tourists and the living quality of the island's residents.
