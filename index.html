					This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2018. For more information, follow the links provided on the left hand side of the page.

					The Mackinac Island Honor Guard is a group of 58 Boy Scouts from Southwestern Michigan who serve on Mackinac Island each year. This group is headed by Troop 623, of St. Joseph, MI. This troop provides half of the Scouts for the contingent each year. The rest of the Scouts are from local troops in the St. Joseph/Benton Harbor region. This contingent stays at the Scout Barracks for one week each year, behind historic Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island. While on the Island, the Scouts serve as the color guard, raising and lowering the Island's flags; as tour guides in State Park buildings and Fort Mackinac; and as as environmental protectors through service projects. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I, Nicholas Payne, have been a member of this contingent for seven years. Starting at the youngest age possible as a First Class Scout, I served in the Governor's mansion my third year and entered the Junior Leadership. As Junior Leadership, I was part of the cadre of scouts responsible for planning, scheduling, and managing the 58 Scouts during our time on the Island. My final year before I turn 18, in the summer of 2013, I will serve as Senior Patrol Leader. The task of training, mentoring, and managing these Scouts will serve as my Senior Leadership Practicum for Culver Military Academy.

					My Senior Service Project as Senior Patrol Leader revolves around three core tenants. These are providing service to Mackinac Island State Park, to provide for the training and instilling of leadership values in young Scouts, and to maintain the tradition of excellence upheld by Troop 623. 
				<p/>
				<p>
					The State Park on Mackinac Island, the first state park in Michigan, consists of the historic Fort Mackinac, a series of buildings in the downtown area, and a majority of the Island's preserved forest area. This will be maintained and served by the Scouts during this week in service projects, as well as in daily service as tour guides and color guard.
				</p> 
				<p>The young Scouts in the Troop, in a range of 13 to 17 years old, will be the subject of leadership training and mentoring. The Boy Scouts of America are dedicated to training leaders and men of character. This provides as opportunity for older, experienced Scouts such as myself to work with and lead younger Scouts. The principle of leading by example is very strong in this program, as leadersip is handed over to new Scouts each year. Each year, the new leaders must have seen properly executed leadership in each position to know the responisiblities of the position and how to carry out their duties. The Honor Guard serves as a mentoring, maturing program for each Scout involved, and the graduating Scouts each year attest to the learning experience of serving on the Honor Guard.
				</p> 
				<p>
					The third tenant of my Senior Service Project is maintaining the tradition of excellence for Troop 623. Troop 623 has been serving on Mackinac Island for fifty two years, the second most senior troop to attend. This Troop has given me a wonderful opportunity by allowing me to serve with them. It is the least I can do as Senior Patrol Leader to do my best, seek the highest standard of performance, and uphold the respected name that is Troop 623 on Mackinac Island.
