				<h3>
					Stakeholders Analysis
				</h3>
				<p>
					In this page you need to include your Stakeholder Identification and Stakeholder Analysis.
				</p>
				<p>
					Who are the stakeholders? They are anyone who would have an impact or interest in the organization and&frasl;or benefit from the outcome of the project. Parents, organizations, the media, businesses, government  officials, teachers, students may be the stakeholders for one project.
				</p>
				<p>
					The steps of  Stakeholder Analysis are explained below:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Identifying Your Stakeholders:</b>
						<p>
							The first step in your stakeholder analysis is to brainstorm who your stakeholders are. As part of this, think of all the people who are affected by your work, who have influence or power over it, or have an interest in its successfull or unsuccessful conclusion.
						</p>
						<p>
							Remember that although stakeholders may be both organizations <b>and</b> people, ultimately you must communicate with people. Make sure that you identify the correct individual stakeholders within a stakeholding organization.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Prioritize Your Stakeholders:</b>
						<p>
							You may now have a long list of people and organizations that are affected by your work. Some of these may have the power either to block or advance. Some may be interested in what you are doing; others may not care.
						</p>
						<p>
							Map out your stakeholders on a Power&frasl;Interest Grid on our free template, and classify them by their power over your work and by their interest in your work.
						</p>
						<div style="float: right; margin-left: 25px;">
							<img src="images/importance-interest-grid.png" title="Power/Interest Grid" />
						</div>
						<p>
							For example, your boss is likely to have high power and influence over your projects and high interest. Your family may have high interest, but are unlikely to have power over it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Someone's position on the grid shows you the actions you have to take with them:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<b>High power, high interest</b>: these are the people you must fully engage and make the greatest efforts to satisfy.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>High power, low interest</b>: you should put enough work in with these people to keep them satisfied, but not so much that they become bored.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Low power, high interest</b>: keep these people adequately informed, and talk to them to ensure that no major issues arise. These people can often be very helpful with the details of your project.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>Low power, low interest</b>: Monitor these people, but do not bore them with excessive communication.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Understanding Your Key Stakeholders:</b>
						<p>
						You now need to know more about your key stakeholders. You need to know how they are likely to feel about and react to your project. You also need to know how best to engage them in your project and how best to communicate with them.
						</p>
						<p>
						At the end, group your stakeholders. Stakeholders can be grouped into these categories:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								Primary Stakeholders &mdash; those involved in every aspect of the project and the recipients of the service.
							</li>
							<li>
								Secondary Stakeholders &mdash; those involved in some of the aspects of the project.
							</li>
							<li>
								Peripheral Stakeholders &mdash; those that may not have helped implement the project, but are a resource. They may not feel that they have much to gain from your project, but are nonetheless supportive.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
