				This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2018. For more information, follow the links provided on the left hand side of the page.

					My project will be impacting a lot of people. For only taking a week out of my summer, I am going to be improving the summers of thousands of other people. The state park on Mackinac gets between eight hundred and a thousand tourists coming through it per day, which is only a small fraction of the tourists on the island. These are all people that will be impacted by my project. Also, the state park on Mackinac, the businesses we buy from, every picture we take of tourist smiling on upper gun deck over the Mackinac straits-everything my project does will be impacting people. Hopefully, this is a positive impact. The meaning of my project now goes way beyond helping the state park, it impacts thousands of families and children in a very direct way.

					The primary stake holder of my project in the Michigan State Park on Mackinac Island. The Park Services are who we volunteer for, and we help them in serving the tourists. They are both primary stakeholders, but I think that the parks service is the number one stakeholder. Running the state park, especially in recent years, has been difficult-the budget to clean and maintain the island is shrinking. My project helps maintain the island for no labor costs-we moved over twenty thousand pounds of cement by hand to help build a new staircase by Arch Rock, we provide experienced and new tourist guides for no cost, we sometimes bring new employees to the island-two of our buglers were offered jobs for their fantastic performance. Every day, I would run the “mail run” and pick up and drop off all of the mail for the park services. My project helped maintain the parks and improve the parks, without draining any of the resources available, and through this improve the vacation of thousands of tourists.
