					This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2018. For more information, follow the links provided on the left hand side of the page.

					This is a review of the goal-setting process.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Goal</b>: The goal of my project is to provide consistent and capable service to Troop 623 and Mackinac Island State park while mentoring and teaching the young Scouts.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Measurable Outcome</b>:
						<ol>
							<li>
								Tourists are satisfied, no complaints from tourists or GSI.

						<b>Objectives</b>:
						<ol>
							<br>
							<li>
								Represent the Boy Scouts and the Governor's Honor Guard with pride and excellence in appearance:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Marching form - rehearsed in two practices and competitively evaluated in the Thursday night marching competition. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Uniform quality - ensured through routine inspections by Patrol Leaders and Assistant Patrol Leaders in formation. Junior Leadership debriefs will communicate uniform standards clearly. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Punctuality - each patrol, under the leadership of the Patrol Leader or Assistant Patrol Leader, will arrive at flag and duty posts on time or early to maintain a professional appearance and troop morale. 
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								Provide excellence in service:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Duty shifts in fort and downtown - overseen by the ASPL and myself each day, the conduct of Scouts will be a key point at all times. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Off-duty service projects - the troop will clean and collect garbage for the Fort as well as taking on at least three service projects during the week.  
									</li>
									<li>
										Flag retirement - Friday night the Troop will host a retirement ceremony and burn the flags no longer fit for use, donated in the St. Joseph region. 
									</li>	
								</ul>
							</li>
							<br>
							<li>
								Display proper function and behavior as a Troop:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Communication - the Troop will be kept informed and updated through proper information dissemination at each meal's announcements and Taps Report. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Behavior - behavior will be moderated by the Junior Leadership and controlled through Extra Duty and the awarding of the Governor's Mansion duty shift. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Off duty activities - euchre, horseshoe, and Magic the Gathering tournaments will be set up in the barracks. In addition, behavior in town while off duty will be stressed and evaluated by youth leadership.
