					This is the website explaining and facilitating the Senior Leadership Practicum of Nicholas Frederick Payne. For one week, I led a group of 58 Scouts on Mackinac Island, a state park in Michigan. This will count towards my ability to graduate from Culver Military Academy, in the Company C class of 2014. For more information, follow the links provided on the left hand side of the page.

					My Senior Service Project will take place on Mackinac Island, in the Mackinac Island State Park. The State Park encompasses the entire island, but the island is also home to a bustling commercial tourist district. The island is a vintage tourist destination due to its historical significance and the unique environment created on the island. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The island is historically significant due to its position in the Great Lakes. The island divides the Straits of Mackinac, a narrow connection between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. This route commanded the fur trade and was militarily significant for both the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. The island was home to the warehouse of the American Fur Company. Run by John Jacob Astor, the island proved a crucial location for the business that created America's first millionaire. The fort was ceded to the US after the Revolutionary War, before being reconquered and then returned by the British in the War of 1812. The Fort, made of Mackinac limestone, became the nation's second national park three years after Yellowstone. The park was later ceded from national control to state control, becoming Michigan's First State Park. Still historically relevant, the Post Cemetery located behind the fort is one of five sites controlled by the American government where the American flag is flown at half mast continuously. It shares this somber honor with Arlington's Tomb of the Unkowns, Arlington House in Arlington National Cemetery, the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, and the cemetery on Normandy Beach.

					The island has a unique atmosphere due to its preserved nineteenth century situation. When the first "horseless carriages" were introduced to the island, the noise frightened the horses used in the carriage industry. In one of the most successful lobbying movements America has seen, the carriage drivers convinced the island council to pass a resolution banning all horseless carriages. Even today in 2013, there are no automobiles on the island except emergency vehicles. The entire island is an equine driven experience. 
				</p>
				<p>
					It is in this environment that I will lead my senior service project. Amidst the remnants of the War of Independence and the War of 1812, in the center of a bustling-at bicycle pace- tourist center, I will lead and train 58 Scouts in a manner befitting the Boy Scouts of America and Culver Military Academy.
